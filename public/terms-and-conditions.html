                    <h2 class="font-bold uppercase text-trueGray-500">Revision Policy</h2>
                    <p class="text-trueGray-500 lg:max-w-[90%] mb-4 text-sm">BeDesigns gives you assurance regarding
                        unlimited
                        revisions
                        according
                        to your particular packages. Clients can ask for revisions as per the package and no extra fee
                        will be charged. However, design and concept will remain identical and the customer can post
                        revision on any one of the provided options. Revision on numerous options is either inadmissible
                        or will be charged discretely. Normal Revision reversal time would be 48 to 72 hours for logo
                        and website design. Similarly, the timelines for functionality and Development revisions may
                        also differ contingent on the scope of work.</p>

                    <h2 class="font-bold uppercase text-trueGray-500">New Order Turnaround Time</h2>
                    <p class="text-trueGray-500 lg:max-w-[90%] mb-4 text-sm">Turnaround time refers to the time in which
                        your
                        design
                        concepts are
                        digitally delivered to you against your package purchase. For all logo new orders, the
                        turnaround time is from 48 hours to maximum 72 hours. However, for packages with four or more
                        logo concepts, the turnaround time is at least 72 hours or more (depending on the amount of
                        work) after order confirmation and complete brief submission. Moreover, in the case of new
                        website design (home/index, including revamp designs, etc.), the minimum turnaround time is 72
                        hours after order confirmation and complete brief submission. Please also note that the
                        turnaround time, as pertains to website development (static website having 5 to 7 webpages) is
                        between five to ten business days. For all orders placed on Friday, Saturday or Sunday, the
                        delivery time starts from Monday. If you have chosen an illustrative logo (logos with
                        illustration element or illustrated design), the first concept will be provided from 48 to 72
                        hours of order confirmation.</p>

                    <h2 class="font-bold uppercase text-trueGray-500">Refund Policy</h2>
